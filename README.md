#  GDG-Node.js-track

This repository contains my work for the GDG Node.js / Express.js track. 
It showcases my progress through weekly tasks, assignments, and projects as I learn backend development with JavaScript.

## 🚀 Project Objective
The purpose of this repository is to document my learning journey in Node.js  and Express.js. . Each task builds on the previous one, helping me practice key concepts of server-side programming, application structure, and modern backend development.

Rather than focusing on a single project, this repo serves as a collection of exercises and implementations that demonstrate how I’m applying what I learn in class. The overall objective is to strengthen my skills in building scalable, maintainable, and professional web applications.
